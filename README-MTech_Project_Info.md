## MTech Thesis Project [May'24 -Present]
I am currently working on a project where

-   **AIM:** to acheive fruit level precision spraying in Orchards.
-   **Approaches:**
-      Sensor: Camera [RGB-D]
-      Utilizing Image Segmentation deep learning model efficient enough to be used in real time applications.

- Earlier tried the Object detection as well. But for our problem we find the Image Segmentation more suitable.

- I will upload the code and resources once the project is finished.
  Thank You!!
